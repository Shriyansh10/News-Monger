        "content": "Toronto (Canadá), 26 may (EFE).- La federación canadiense de fútbol, Canada Soccer, anunció este jueves que ha cancelado el partido amistoso que la selección masculina absoluta de Canadá tenían previsto disputar contra el equipo nacional de Irán tras las protestas de grupos iraníes y partidos políticos. Canada Soccer anunció en un escueto comunicado de un párrafo la cancelación del partido previsto para el 5 de junio en la localidad canadiense de Vancouver pero sin ofrecer ninguna explicación de la decisión. El anuncio de la cancelación del partido amistoso, que era parte de la preparación de la selección canadiense de fútbol de cara al mundial de Qatar 2022, se produce después de varias semanas de protestas. Tan pronto como Soccer Canada anunció el amistoso, familiares de ciudadanos canadienses que murieron cuando la Guardia Revolucionaria de Irán derribó en enero de 2020 el vuelo 752 de Ukraine International Arlines (UIA) sobre Teherán, cuestionaron el partido y solicitaron su cancelación. En el ataque con misiles antiaéreos murieron 176 personas, entre ellos 55 canadienses de origen iraní y 30 iraníes que eran residentes permanentes en Canadá. Tras oír las quejas de los familiares de los fallecidos, el primer ministro canadiense, Justin Trudeau, cuestionó el partido amistoso y dijo que no era una buena idea. El principal partido de la oposición, el Partido Conservador, también solicitó la cancelación del amistoso y aprovechó la oportunidad para atacar al Gobierno de Trudeau. Las protestas aumentaron cuando en las últimas horas se supo que Soccer Canada acordó pagar a Irán 400.000 dólares canadienses (313.000 dólares estadounidenses) por la participación del equipo nacional iraní. Canadá se ha clasificado para la Copa Mundial de Fútbol que se disputará este año en Qatar por primera vez en 36 años. Canadá jugará en el Grupo F, el mismo en el que se encuentran Bélgica, Croacia y Marruecos.

        "content": "Amber Whiting is the seventh BYU’s women’s head coach in program history. She comes to BYU after coaching in the high school ranks in Idaho.Courtesy BYU So, BYU replaces Jeff Judkins with a high school coach from Idaho named Amber Whiting.What should one make of this hire? Time will tell.We can be certain it is going to be an adjustment for Whiting and a big challenge to replace Judkins. One of her first tasks will be to recruit every one of Judkins’ returning players because when an outside hire takes place, it is kind of like a divorce for players — that a member of their family, their special team, did not get the job.It is way too early to judge Whiting, a former BYU player.She has been given a tremendous opportunity and she sold herself to BYU’s administration.And that’s what many can focus on, is the chance, the break, the opportunity.BYU’s athletic legacy is wrought with hiring first-time Division I head coaches. It oftentimes goes this route rather than chasing established coaches. It’s kind of a rite of passage at BYU, known for saving money by hiring talent with potential and crossing fingers that it turns out OK, hopefully sooner rather than later. Related Championship week is here for the Cougars Dennis Pitta on why he completed degree 13 years after leaving BYU for the NFL This was the case when LaVell Edwards was elevated to replace Tommy Hudspeth in the early ’70s. Edwards had never been a college head coach before. He made it to the Hall of Fame and ranks as one of the winningest coaches of all time.It was the case two decades earlier when BYU elevated freshman basketball coach and former Jordan High and Dixie College coach Stan Watts as head basketball coach. He was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.Frank Arnold, the last coach to take BYU basketball to the Elite Eight in the early ’80s, got his first Division I head coaching job at BYU after working as an assistant at Oregon and UCLA and being head coach at Clark Junior College.Bronco Mendenhall got his first head coaching job at BYU in 2005, which he parlayed into millions before retiring at the University of Virginia. His replacement, current head coach Kalani Sitake, got his first head coaching job at BYU and is fresh off a 21-4 record the past two seasons after his hire in 2015.Roger Reid, a successful high school coach and assistant coach at Weber State, got the call after Ladell Andersen quit. He became BYU’s all-time percentage winner before his stint as head coach concluded.Reid’s replacement, Steve Cleveland, got his first Division I head coaching job at BYU, elevated from head coach at Fresno City College. Related Just how loaded is this BYU track team heading into NCAA prelims this week? Mitch Mathews on ‘Mangum’s Miracle,’ and Kalani Sitake’s culture The program has a stellar record of giving women their first head coaching experiences at the Division I level. This includes current volleyball coach Heather Olmstead and soccer coach Jennifer Rockwood. Both have had dominating, successful coaching careers at BYU with championships and coach-of-the-year honors.BYU tapped Elaine Michaelis to coach field hockey, basketball and volleyball, her first Division I coaching jobs. Michaelis ended up one of the top three Division I coaches in wins and at the time of her retirement, she led all divisions in wins.The late Ann Valentine was hired at BYU from being an assistant at ASU and quickly became a dominating women’s tennis coach for the athletic program. After 27 years as head tennis coach, she has posted more wins than any Division I coach in college history and is in the College Tennis Hall of Fame.Remember when NFL coach Andy Reid hired high school coaches Doug Pederson and Matt Nagy as NFL coordinators? They went on to be head coaches with the Eagles and Bears. Nagy was named the NFL’s coach of the year in 2018.Jess Simpson was one of the most successful high school coaches in Georgia history. He skipped coaching college and went straight to defensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons.Finally, Jeff Judkins had plenty of experience working as an assistant to Utah’s Rick Majerus, but he’d never been a Division I head coach until BYU tapped him to lead the women’s program. In the course of his career, he became the winningest basketball coach in school history — for men or women.First-time Division I head coaching gigs have been a staple of BYU’s approach to athletics over the decades.Time and time again, BYU has rolled the dice and avoided snake eyes.Now, Whiting has received the call. She’s a rookie at the Division I level. She’s coming straight out of coaching high school and AAU hoops.Will she succeed?Nobody can make that prediction the week after her hire.But she has been given a chance.Sometimes chances are a portal. Michael Jordan found this out when a chance was taken away and returned later, after the head coach at Laney High sent him down to the junior varsity team to ripen him up. In time, he got called up to varsity and became a legend.Sometimes a chance is all you need.",

Ecco le parole della rossonera Noemi Fedele, portiere del Milan Femminile, si è raccontata a Ho Soccer Italy. Ecco le parole della rossonera: «Ho iniziato a tirare i primi calcio al pallone nella squadra maschile del Maliseti, per poi arrivare alla Fiorentina, dove sicuramente ci sono statele emozionipiù forti perché abbiamo vinto Campionato, Coppa Italia e Supercoppa, conquistando anche la qualificazione per la Champions. Qui ho trascorso circa 8 anni e poi ho deciso di intraprendere una nuova avventura nella Serie B spagnola, per poi tornare in Italia, prima all’Empoli ed ora al Milan, squadra nella quale spero di rimanere più a lungo possibile» ESSERE PORTIERE – «Secondo me essere portiere non lo scegliamo noi, ma è questo ruolo che ci sceglie. Diciamo che io ero già indirizzata in questa posizione, perché quando ero più piccola andavo sempre a vedere gli allenamenti e le partite di mio fratello, che tutt’ora è portiere in Eccellenza ed è per me fonte di ispirazione per la dedizione e il sacrificio che fa ogni giorno per questo sport. Spero un giorno di diventare come lui» PROFESSIONISMO – «Il professionismo per noi è un passo importante, credo che questo sia il primo passo verso qualcosa di veramente bello. Noi calciatrici siamo fiere dipoter entrare tutte nell’ottica che questo adesso è a tuttigli effetti il nostro lavogo, cosa che poche società come il Milan già fa da tempo» AMBIZIONI «Arrivare un giorno nella Nazionale maggiore e dipoter giocare nella massima serie. Alle bambine le incoraggerei a buttarsi in tutti i sensi in questo ruolo, che a parer mio è il più bello. Magari sono di parte, però non saprei spiegare la sensazione che si prova dopo aver parato un rigore, o fatto un intervento decisivo, aver cambiato le sorti della partita con le tue decisioni. Sono tutte cose che messe insieme formano un’esplosione di belle emozioni Quindi bambine fatevi avanti che abbiamo bisogno di nuovi talenti tra i pali» The post Fedele: «Spero di rimanere al Milan il più a lungo possibile» appeared first on Milan News 24.",

        "content": "Colorado Rapids have the chance to go above Nashville SC in the MLS Western Conference standings with a win on Saturday against the visitors. Nashville are currently sixth, occupying the penultimate playoff position, just one point ahead of Colorado who are ninth, level with Houston Dynamo in that final spot. © Reuters It has been a decent start from both of these sides, who will play each other for the first ever time on Saturday. Nashville have only played two full seasons in the MLS and they were spent in the Eastern Conference, so a switch to the West for this year has presented their first opportunity to play Colorado. In their two campaigns so far, Nashville have finished inside the playoff positions so they are currently around where they expected to be at this stage. Whether the same can be said for Colorado however, is quite a grey area after they finished top of the Western Conference in 2021. They were ultimately eliminated in the playoff semi-finals but hoped to kick on in 2022, rather than be lingering on the edge hoping to sneak in. Nonetheless, with 13 games played it is still early stages but Colorado need to find some consistency and end a run of just three wins in 10 games, if they want to be comfortable inside the playoffs. It is up-front where they have struggled, scoring the joint-third lowest amount of goals (15) in the Western Conference this season. However, it is Saturday's visitors they share that tally with, Nashville's top scorer this season only netting four goals so far. Compare that to Colorado and their top scorer, Diego Rubio , only has six goals this year so both teams need their forward line to step up. Therefore, it is through remaining defensively solid that has allowed them to push for a playoff position in the early stages of this MLS season. Only Dallas have conceded fewer goals than Colorado (14), with Nashville shipping just one more than this weekend's opponents, which should give both sides confidence for the season. However, looking at purely this weekend, two sides who are good in defence but poor in attack, does not usually set up an all-time classic. © Reuters Colorado defender Auston Trusty will be back available for selection, after his suspension forced him to miss the last match against Seattle Sounders. Meanwhile, the home side will still be without Braian Galvan , who is out for the long-term with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The list of those unavailable for Nashville, however, is a lot more extensive with Irakoze Donasivano and Robert Castellanos both out injured. They are also joined by Randall Leal , who suffered an ankle injury last week, while Teal Bunbury has been sidelined with a knee problem since March. Colorado Rapids possible starting lineup: Yarbrough; Abubakar, Wilson, Trusty; Beitashour, Price, Acosta, Markanich; Kaye, Barrios, Rubio Nashville SC possible starting lineup: Willis; Miller, Zimmerman, Romney; Muyl, Lovitz, Davis, Anunga, Godoy; Mukhtar, Sapong These are two sides searching for consistent form and are very evenly matched in terms of quality. With good defences and struggles up front, it is likely that a low-scoring draw will be the outcome.

        "content": "comments The 37-year-old year old Scot, known for playing Detective Inspector Steve Arnott in Line Of Duty, will return to play for Soccer Aid 2022 as part of the World XI team. Before becoming an actor, he played for Scottish professional football club Greenock Morton. Now McClure has announced she will also be taking part – on the opposing English side. The actress, who plays Kate Fleming in the popular BBC drama, took to Twitter ahead of the match, warning her TV pal she is determined to win. She said: “I'm joining this year's Soccer Aid for UNICEF. I'm going to whip the England team into shape, but mainly I want to make sure we beat the rest of the world with Martin Compston .” Compston responded on his own Twitter account, joking: “England training now consisting of Tik-Tok dance videos followed by Greggs for lunch.” Last month, Compston said it was becoming an actor that allowed him to achieve his footballing dreams. Speaking to the PA news agency ahead of the match, he said: “It’s a weird thing in terms of I gave up on my dream of being a footballer when I was 17, when I was playing Scottish second division with (Greenock) Morton, but I was very realistic that that was probably about my level. “So, weirdly, by giving up on that, I’ve sort of achieved my dreams, playing at all these amazing stadiums in front of huge crowds, with genuine legends, people who I would have never got to share a pitch with, so I’m very grateful for that.” Among the famous faces also taking to the pitch at the London Stadium will be Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt, singer Liam Payne and TV presenter Alex Brooker. Compston also revealed that he finds himself starstruck and “shaking” when he meets his footballing idols, saying: “I don’t really get overly starstruck in terms of in our industry, because, you know, it’s just our work, but with footballers I really do. “There’s times I can be shaking, when you see people like Roberto Carlos. “For somebody who grew up as a football fanatic, it’s an incredible feeling.” He added: “Playing on a pitch with (Alessandro) Del Piero and (Clarence) Seedorf and all these incredible names – it’s guys I grew up watching in Champions League finals.” Speaking about his former career as a professional footballer, Compston admitted he still faces pressure from his home town and friends to perform well when playing for Soccer Aid. “You’re terrified of going home and getting a slagging from your mates. People in Greenock, my home town, my pals, they’re pretty ruthless – they’ll let you know if you had a bad game,” he said. – Soccer Aid for Unicef 2022 takes place at the London Stadium on Sunday June 12, with tickets on sale now at https://www.socceraid.org.uk/tickets/ Want to join the conversation?

The jerseys will be worn on field by MLS clubs May 27-29 . Major League Soccer and adidas are raising awareness and inspiring action surrounding the impact of marine plastic waste by featuring customized Primeblue uniforms made from a high-performance recycled material and Parley Ocean Plastic™. Inter Miami CF went underwater to launch their jersey and highlight the beauty of a healthy ocean. From beach clean ups to plastic waste campaigns, members of the soccer community are spreading awareness and taking action to prevent ocean plastic pollution. Committed to taking steps to address its environmental impact, MLS and adidas' teamed up to create Primeblue jerseys which are made from plastics intercepted from beaches, coastal communities, and shorelines, preventing them from polluting the ocean. Once collected, the original plastic source is reworked into technical fibers that can then be repurposed for use in either apparel or footwear. The high-performance yarn features more than 50% Parley Ocean Plastic™ on each jersey. \"Major League Soccer is committed to reducing our carbon footprint and raising awareness about environmental issues, including plastic waste on land and in water,\" said JoAnn Neale , MLS' President and Chief Administrative Officer. \"We are thrilled to have an innovative partner like adidas that enables our clubs to sport kits that inspire the soccer community to join together to preserve our ocean and create a cleaner world.\" MLS also teamed up with We Are Social New York, a global socially-led creative agency, to develop content that sheds light on the effects of plastic waste in our oceans. Photographer Eric White brought a crew together to participate in a cleanup at Great Kills beach in Staten Island while showcasing the Primeblue jerseys. The event highlighted how even a small group can take big steps towards creating a more sustainable future. Visit MLSsoccer.com to view the content. In addition to Primeblue jerseys being worn on field by clubs throughout the weekend's matches, many MLS clubs have made efforts in their local communities to create sustainable projects and educate people on the harmful impact of marine plastic pollution.

MLS WORKS is the League's social responsibility platform. A sampling of club activations include: Inter Miami FC – Inter Miami CF went underwater to launch their Primeblue adidas jersey.

Seattle Sounders FC – Seattle Sounders FC is proud to be the first carbon neutral professional soccer club in North America and the first carbon neutral pro sports team in the United States .

Earlier this year, select MLS clubs and adidas teamed up on a sustainability initiative to help keep plastic waste out of landfills. As part of the program, nine games were hosted where fans were given a reusable tote and a separate mailer to take home and fill with donations to send to the adidas Give Back program. The Give Back program accepts gently used clothes and shoes from any brand and rewards participants with adiClub points and vouchers to use on adidas.com. In addition to these 9 games, the Colorado Rapids hosted a Sustainability game on April 23 where they collected over 2,000 gently used items from fans. These items were donated to local charities.
